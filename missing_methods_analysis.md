# Missing Solana RPC Methods Analysis

Based on the current implementation (63 methods) and standard Solana RPC API, here are the missing methods that should be implemented:

## Context Methods (High Priority)
These add context information (slot, etc.) to existing method responses:

1. `getAccountInfoAndContext` - Account info with context
2. `getBalanceAndContext` - Balance with context  
3. `getProgramAccountsAndContext` - Program accounts with context
4. `getMultipleAccountsAndContext` - Multiple accounts with context

## Performance/Monitoring Methods (High Priority)

5. `getRecentPerformanceSamples` - Get recent performance samples
6. `getRecentPrioritizationFees` - Get recent prioritization fees for transactions
7. `getSignatureStatuses` - Get signature confirmation statuses
8. `getBlockCommitment` - Get block commitment info

## Additional Block/Transaction Methods

9. `getSnapshotSlot` - Get snapshot slot (if exists in client)
10. `getStakeActivation` - Get stake activation information (if exists in client)

## Methods that CAN'T be implemented:
- WebSocket subscription methods (accountSubscribe, etc.) - require WebSocket
- Methods that don't exist in Solana client library

## Implementation Plan:
1. Add context versions of existing methods (straightforward)
2. Add performance monitoring methods
3. Add remaining transaction/block methods if available in client
4. Update tool definitions and documentation
