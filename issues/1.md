Title: MCP Inspector CI: Protocol test times out (server does not respond)

Body:
### Summary
The MCP Inspector Compatibility Test job ([see job](https://github.com/openSVM/solana-mcp-server/actions/runs/17344113947/job/49241845180)) is failing due to a 60s timeout while waiting for the solana-mcp-server to respond to protocol requests. The test script reports:

```
‚ùå Test timeout after 60 seconds
Test results so far: { initialize: false, toolsList: false }
```

### Details
- The test script never receives the 'initialize' or 'toolsList' responses from the MCP server process.
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/mcp-inspector.yml`
- The script launches the server, but protocol requests time out.

### Possible Causes
- The server process does not start or listen on the expected port before the test begins.
- The test script does not wait for server readiness.
- The server crashes or fails to bind the port.

### Suggested Fix
- Ensure the MCP server is started and ready before protocol tests begin. Add a port or log-based readiness check to the test script.
- Capture and print the server's stdout/stderr in CI for debugging.
- Optionally, increase the timeout or add retries while waiting for the server to be ready.
